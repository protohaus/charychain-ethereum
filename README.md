This is the Repository related to the Master Thesis "Design and Evaluation of Smart Contracts for a
non-profit Donations-Service", it was sucessfully submitted to TU Braunschweig on November 9th 2022. 

Abstract of the thesis: 
In this thesis we perform a practice-oriented comparison of the Ethereum and Cardano blockchain regarding smart contract development. The objective is to implement a non-profit donations service on both of these blockchains to evaluate the whole development process in a comprehensive way. This is covered by our methodology that divides the evaluation in subjective and objective factors. This aims at being able to structurally learn about perceived implications of development as well as about advantages and disadvantages of technology model, ecosystem and programming requirements. We find that the Ethereum blockchain is more suitable for use cases with complex data without many operations on them as well as for inexperienced programmers who want to start developing smart contracts. Cardano on the contrary is more suitable for simple data structures with low logical complexity but requires experienced programmers and high operational resources. We develop the comparison as a reusable method that gives comprehensive insights into the whole development process of a blockchain. This includes the suitability of software metrics to indicate program sections in need of improvement as well as a need for more comprehensive design- and development frameworks that cover technical differences of various blockchains. 

This Repository contains the related contracts that are the implementation on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Based on the results of this thesis, the Protohaus decided to not continue the implementation of the donations-service use case.
